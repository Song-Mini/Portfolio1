Computer engineering is a field that deals with software running on all kinds of devices with computing capabilities, including computers, smartphones, cars, home appliances, drones, and wearables. Computer engineering technology is rapidly changing the world we live in. Smartphones have already become essential items. The AI software AlphaGo defeated the Go player Lee Sedol. ChatGPT has revolutionized conversational learning, ushering in a new era of artificial intelligence. Drones are increasingly being used for filming dramas, monitoring national parks, and quick deliveries. Big data technology is paving the way for non-medical professionals to develop new drugs, and 3D printers can create shoes that fit my feet perfectly. It won’t be long before autonomous vehicles appear on the roads. Internet of Things (IoT) technology will enable smart farms by attaching sensors to fruit trees, and robots will perform heartwarming tasks such as rescuing people from fire scenes. Underlying these amazing applications is the technology of “computer engineering.”

Upon entering the [Department of Computer and Artificial Intelligence](https://csai.jbnu.ac.kr/csai/29023/subview.do), students begin with foundational studies to strengthen their programming skills. They then refine their abilities in creating fast and efficient software, software engineering techniques for large-scale software development, and programming skills necessary for creating and operating system software. In their later years, they will learn advanced skills such as game and multimedia software development, big data processing software development, artificial intelligence program development, security and network programming, and embedded software development that controls hardware, all while preparing for graduate school or employment.

Many predictions suggest that significant changes will occur in future job landscapes. It is forecasted that jobs will shrink from simple roles like assembly workers and drivers to professional roles like doctors and lawyers. These predictions are quite accurate, calculated using big data. What drives this change in the job landscape? It is precisely the computer engineering technologies mentioned earlier. The job opportunities in computer engineering are expanding both qualitatively and quantitatively.
